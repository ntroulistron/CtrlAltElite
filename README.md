Gameplay Overview:

	"Elite Zombies" starts by immersing the player into a survival horror scenario within a grim and ominous prison. The game begins with the player standing beside a table equipped with some game basic survival tools. These tools include a gun, a crowbar, ammunition, and apples that can restore health. The inclusion of these items right at the start prepares the player for the exploration of the prison.

Encounter with the Mutated Monster Boss:

	During the exploration phase, in the depths of the prison the player encounters a mutated monster who is a stronger challenge than other's the player encountered begore. This monster is stronger and more resilient than the regular zombies and upon defeating the mutated beast the horde starts to rise again to hunt and avenge the player. Defeating the mutated monster requires more powerfull weapons that the player is only able to find through exploration soo the player is encouraged to do so.

Horde Survival:

	Once the mutated monster is dead, the game shifts its gameplay into the survival phase where waves of zombies begin to spawn. These zombies appear randomly around the prison, keeping the player on their toes as they must constantly be aware of their surroundings.

Resource Management:

	Survival in "Elite Zombies" is not just about shooting and killing zombies, it also has some resource management.

Health apples, which can restore the player's health, become much more needed as the waves continue. The respawn timers on these resources add a type of strategy, as players must decide and remember where they are and when to use them.

Victory and Game End:

	The ultimate goal in "Elite Zombies" is to survive all 10 waves of the hordes. Each wave brings sustained pressure, testing the player's strategy and resource management.
